 <h1> IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK

## About the project
 
This is an example application for solving image classification task based on deep neural network. More information about the algorithm can be found below. 
 
 ## Requirements
 1. Pandas 
 2. PyTorch version==1.7 
 3. Numpy
 4. Sklearn 
 5. Pillow (PIL)
 6. Matplotlib
 
## Some key architectural insights into the project
 Run the file CatsAndDogClassification.py to train and test my cats&dogs dataset. 
 To test my train model, I have saved best trained model into "bestModel" folder.
 For training your own dataset, download your dataset into the folder named "dataset".
 Using sklearn library, split your data into train and test datasets (usually 20% of data are kept for testing the model). 
 Separate labels and data using pandas dataframe.
 Try to train your data on my model or modify it properly to fit with your data and annotations. 
 Save your best model into "BestModel" folder, then test it using test_model function. 
 
 ENJOY TRAINING YOUR CLASSIFICATION SCRIPT.
